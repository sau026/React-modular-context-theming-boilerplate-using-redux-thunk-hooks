# React modular context theming boilerplate using redux(thunk) & hooks

A modular React boilerplate, which can be used for highly scalable and reusable apps and components. It builds with Performance-Focused, Best practices & Architecture. This boilerplate has three different theming modes (Day, Night & Purple Color). I have used Redux(Thunk) and hooks to design this app.

This project was generated with [React] version 16.13.1.

## Note (To run this boilerplate, clone this repository first)
For using this boilerPlate, Please take a clone of Node JS boiler plate (https://github.com/sau026/NodeJS-boilerplate-with-auth-and-crud-operation) and run it, It required for data and API which is used in React boilerplate. 

Steps to run this Node JS boiler plate is mentioned on this link (https://github.com/sau026/NodeJS-boilerplate-with-auth-and-crud-operation).

Features:-- 
* Redux
* Thunk
* ES6 / ES7
* ImmutableJS
